# Infinite Scroll
This repository was created to make a page that mimics an infinite scroll of images. The images were fetched using the Unsplash API.

## Github Page
Link to the quote generator page: [https://hnhsnt.github.io/infinite-scroll/](https://hnhsnt.github.io/infinite-scroll/)

## Usage
This page generates images as you scroll through the page. To see more images, just scroll down at the bottom of the page. You can also hover on the image to see the description, and click on it to bring you to the Unsplash site where the image was originally uploaded.
